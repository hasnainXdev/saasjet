# **SaaSJet** 🚀

**A lean, production-ready open-source SaaS boilerplate** that lets you launch your idea in days, not weeks built with modern tools, minimal overhead, and real-world priorities in mind.

We built SaaSJet because most boilerplates either drown you in unnecessary complexity (like forced multi-tenancy or enterprise-scale features) or leave critical pieces missing. This one focuses on what actually matters for indie hackers and solo founders shipping a paid product: secure auth, reliable billing, a polished dashboard, and a solid foundation you can deploy today. No upsell to a "pro" version everything here is free and open-source under MIT.

# **Why SaaSJet Stands Out**

After researching dozens of open-source Next.js SaaS boilerplates, we found many great options, but SaaSJet differentiates by staying intentionally minimal while being fully functional. Here's how it compares to popular alternatives:

1. [Vs. ixartz/SaaS-Boilerplate](https://github.com/ixartz/SaaS-Boilerplate): Robust with multi-tenancy and advanced features, but can feel heavy. SaaSJet keeps it lightweight no forced extras, pure Prisma, and native Stripe without premium lock-in.

2. [Vs. mickasmt/next-saas-stripe-starter](): Great with roles and emails, but includes more opinionated additions. SaaSJet strips down to essentials for faster customization.

3. [Vs. Official Next.js SaaS Starter](): Solid basics, but often pairs with Drizzle/Supabase. SaaSJet uses Prisma + PostgreSQL for maximum flexibility and type-safety.

If you're tired of over-engineered starters that slow you down, SaaSJet gets you to MVP without the fluff.
